haskell-2048
============

Implementation of 2048 in haskell with Artificial Intelligence

Currently, the game runs with a text based interface and plays itself by default with a naive randomized agent

Plan on writing more agents since a game driver exists and has been tested

I decided not to build this project with cabal because it breaks my computer. 

To run the tests you need to install hspec

This assumes that you have haskell and cabal installed. 

<code>cabal install hspec</code>
